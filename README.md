<h3><b>GNOMES LOGIN</b></h3>
<p>Although all the gnomes are able to use the app, only two of them have sign-up yet. One of them is <b><i>jonoesido</b></i> whose password is <b><i>macarrones!</b></i> and the other one is <b><i>anadando</b></i>, whose password is <b><i>torrijas!</b></i></p>

<h3><b>TODOS</b></h3>
<p>The exigence level of the gnomes is high as hell, but the developer of this app is really busy this days, so he has asked the gnomes some suggestions to improve it ASAP when he can search some time to get on it</p>
<p>"You have not implemented a test yet!! Test at least that this thing can at least route well! And also test service interaction!!" Tobus claimed in anger... </p>
<p>"For David The Gnome's sake!! That filter thing freezes the page when terms are typed quickly! Just try to change the render structure to make it asyncronous or delay the filtering for succesive iterations not to be chained" Emmadette's suggestion, always helpfull.</p>
<p>"Overall it looks great, but I can still find some flaws, some adjust to be made in responsiveness for concrete inputs and elements, feedback to user is missing in some cases..."</p>
